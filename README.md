### üëã Hi folks!

‚úÖ I am a second-year **Doctor of Philosophy** (PhD) candidate, focusing on **Computer Vision** and **Deep Learning**, at [**SketchX Lab**](www.sketchx.ai), [**Centre for Vision, Speech and Signal Processing (CVSSP)**](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/centre-vision-speech-signal-processing) of the [**University of Surrey**](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/), England, United Kingdom (UK) with a fully-funded iFlyTek-Surrey joint scholarship. My supervisors are [**Prof. Yi-Zhe Song (SonG)**](http://personal.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Personal/Y.Song/) and [**Prof. Tao Xiang (Tony)**](http://personal.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Personal/T.Xiang/index.html).

üë®‚Äçüíª Before starting my PhD, I worked as an Image Processing and deep Learning Engineer at [**The MathWorks**](www.mathworks.com), specializing in Digital Image Processing, Pattern Recognition, Multi and hyperspectral imaging, Deep Learning, and Medical Image Analysis. Prior to that, I worked as a Graduate Engineer at [**Johnson Controls**](www.johnsoncontrol.com).

üë®‚Äçüéì In 2018, I completed my Bachelor of Technology (B. Tech) from the West Bengal University of Technology, Kolkata, India, majoring in Electronics and Communication Engineering. 

‚ö° **Top Venue Publications:** 8 X **CVPR**, 1 X **ICCV**
